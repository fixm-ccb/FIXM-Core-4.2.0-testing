# To-do list

This is just a to-do list to track pending things.

- [x] Review/Update Home Page

- [x] Internal references to links (search chapter)
- [ ] Image captions (Should they include the **Figure** title?) (tooltip)
- [x] Footnotes (as a Notes section per page) (Check if this can be excluded from sidebar)
- [x] External links / References (home page with complete list of references, and add invisible list of references for maintenance)
- [x] FIXM Schema links (Step1: add links for xsd files e.g. https://fixm.aero/releases/FFICE-Msg-1.0.0/schemas/applications/fficemessage/fficetemplates/filingstatus/flight/flightroutetrajectory/FficeFS_FlightRouteTrajectory.xsd).
- [x] Page width
- [x] Complete initial load

- [x] Usage of [...] in code blocks is not compatible with sintax highlighting FIX: use comments or quotes for those
- [x] We can improve codeblocks by formatting the code to avoid horrizontal scrollbars FIX: break some lines
- [x] FAA to provide image for extensions section with NAS extension (Ask TJ)

- [x] Alignment with Initial Load proposal: move section `ATS MESSAGE TO FIXM MAPPING` under `USING FIXM IN SUPPORT OF FF-ICE`, move section `USE OF SCHEMATRON` under `General rules for data correctness`, delete section `Sample XML`
- [x] Enrich the list of Acronyms which is currently not in synch with the content of the initial load (acronyms not appearing in the initial load have been removed already from the list)

## Proposals

- [x] Remove Target audience as a page for some sections. Maybe substitude by "Introcudtion" or "About this section", where we can provide a *landing page* for the section, with a table of contents, etc. FIX: Add to home page
- [ ] Revisit usage of bold and italics
- [ ] Text refering to examples is sometimes above and sometimes bellow. This could be harmonised (not urgent)
- [ ] We should document markdown practices for the FIXM user manual. For example: Use `inline code` when refering to a FIXM package, class, property, pattern or value.
- [ ] Include links to the AIRM.aero into the list of acronyms (home page)
- [x] Add a trailing "Submit content for this page" to each page that would open the "Contact us" page on www.FIXM.aero with pre-filled fields . See "Submit Content" on the home page as an illustration.

## Notes from TIM Meeting

- [x] Use **FIXM Application** instead of FIXM Application Library
- [x] "Potential shortcomings of XSD..." new title (see proposal in slides)
- [x] Add note on namespaces (see slides)
- [ ] Prepare diagram for users to choose if extension
