# Introduction

## Creating an Extension step by step

- When creating a restriction, XML elements are eliminated by removing them from the model
- Optionality, cardinality, and pattern restrictions can all be further restricted by applying the desired changes to the restricted class.
- Because XSD complex type restrictions must use the same namespace as the types they restrict, it is necessary to change their names.
